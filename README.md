# An Introduction to Initium Blockchain Project
Web-Scale Blockchain for fast, secure, scalable, dApps and marketplaces.
Developing a new blockchain architecture by considering Vitalik Buterin's trilemma is a challenging task as the developers face a set of three significant challenges, decentralization, security, and scalability. It's widely believed that the blockchains are built to force developers to sacrifice one of the aspects in favor of the two, as they can only provide two of the three benefits at any given time. 
 
Although scalability is an essential issue for broader adoption of the blockchain technology, especially for micropayments and dApps, the developers and users need an optimum network that can provide them with three benefits of the blockchain. 
 
Time synchronization among network partners is a fundamental requirement for efficient and reliable communication on a global scale. Typical synchronization schemes like NTP operate on a trust-based client-server model, which does not scale well in a decentralized network. Single server failures can lead to severe downtime before re-establishing synchronization. 
 
Initium's consensus, the Proof of Synchronization (PoSync), also called Covenant, will provide a seamless solution for the synchronization of nodes throughout the network, which is highly cost-effective while keeping the decentralization, security, and scalability. It makes the Initium a potential network to be used by IoT machines, dApps, marketplaces, and micropayments. 

The Initium project is a layer-1 blockchain protocol for smart contract developed based on the Rust and WASM. Initium Foundation, as a DAO, aims to develop the Initium ecosystem through the participation of developers and volunteers around the world. At the time of compiling this Whitepaper, the test codes of the project are available as an open-source project on GitHub. The developing team of Initium is currently working on developing SDK, wallet, and the different modules required to prepare the project for the test net.

The Initium Foundation's team is updating the current codes, and the new updates and releases will be published on the Initium repository. As Initium Foundation is a fully Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO), it's open to participants to improve the codes and projects.
