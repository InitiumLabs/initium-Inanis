What is Inanis?
Inanis (the Void in Latins) is the initial code of the Initium blockchain. These codes are yet to be tested and considered as 
the WIP for the initial operational version of the Initium blockchain project. 

The naming of all versions of the Initium blockchain will be in Latins. Initium Foundation will propose such names.
